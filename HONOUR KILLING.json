            "- Honor killing or shame killing is the homicide of a member of a family by other 
                members, due to the perpetrators’ belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor 
                upon the family, or has violated the principles of a community or a religion, usually for 
                reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage, being in a relationship that is 
                disapproved by their family, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, 
                dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, engaging in non-heterosexual relations 
                or renouncing a faith. 
            - In Lata Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2006), the Supreme Court opined that “There is nothing honourable in honor killings and they are wholly illegal”. 
            - The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Shakti Vahini v. Union of India (2018), 
                ruled that it was illegal for so called khap panchayats, or assemblies of village elders, to 
                interfere in marriage between two consenting adults, and to summon and punish them. "
