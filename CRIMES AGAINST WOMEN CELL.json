            " The crimes against women cell was set up in 1983 at the central level in the Delhi Police. 
             The need for a gender-specific police response had been felt for some time earlier due to 
            the following reasons: 
            i. Low status of women, 
            ii. Little inclination to take their problems to police stations staffed largely by male 
            police officers who did not show sensitiveness towards female victims. 
             In 1986, separate cells on similar lines were set up in each of the nine districts of Delhi. 
            Most importantly, the central Crimes against Women Cell was provided with enhanced 
            manpower, infrastructure and responsibilities. 
             Counseling of families is an essential part of the functioning of these cells. 
             Other cities and states in India have set up similar units within their police forces with 
            some southern states experimenting with all woman police stations to provide a more 
            enabling environment for women complaints. "
